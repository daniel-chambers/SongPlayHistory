## Notes
- Recording play data begins when you first install this plugin. (This doesn't apply to play counts.)
- The data file `SongPlayData.json` is created in Beat Saber's `UserData` directory. You can delete individual records from there if you want.
- The data are not uploaded anywhere so you have to **backup** the file when re-installing the game.
- If you run into any problem, please contact me either via Discord _(Search me in the BSMG discord server)_ or by open an issue.
